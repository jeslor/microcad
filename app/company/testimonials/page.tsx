              Being a small non-profit, it’s been great working with a local big business that treats us just as big! At Microcad, we have never felt like a number, and we have certainly never felt like ‘the little guy.’ Quite the contrary! Having a direct line to Tim, who constantly goes above and beyond to customize services to meet the diverse needs of our amazing clients, has been a difference-maker. Beyond all that, Microcad, we also appreciate your willingness to not only host work experience placements through our employment training programs, but to walk-the-talk with your proactive, client-first approach to workplace training and accommodations.
              Thank you Microcad! And thank you Tim! We are grateful for the work you do and the way you do it! Local businesses like you truly helps us to Do Opportunity Differently!”
